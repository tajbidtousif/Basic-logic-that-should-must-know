# Basic-logic-that-we-should-know
So hey everyone, As a IT based student we should must know some basic programing logic no matter which IT sector your choose.  

# Question 1
Make a function named make_sum() which will take two floating values as parameters and return their sum

# Question 2
Make a function named make_average() which will take an array of integers and the size of that array and return the average of those values.

# Question 3:
Make a function named count_zero() which will take a binary string (Binary string is a string which is consist of only 0 and 1) as parameter and count how many 0â€™s are there in that string

# Question 4:
Make a function named check_array() which will take an array of integers and the size of that array N. It will return a boolean type whether this array has all values from 1 to N or not.

# Question 5:
Make a pointer variable P which points to an integer variable. Make another pointer variable Q which points to the pointer P. Now make another pointer variable R which points to the pointer Q. Now change the value of that integer variable by accessing pointer R.
